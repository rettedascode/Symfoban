You are working inside an existing Symfony 6 project (symfony/skeleton) that is already initialized as a Git repository on GitHub named "Symfoban".
Technology stack:
- PHP 8+, Symfony 6, Doctrine ORM, Twig
- Frontend styling: TailwindCSS via CDN only
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
- No frontend build tooling (no Webpack, Encore, Vite)
- JavaScript: vanilla ES6 modules or inline scripts

Git requirements:
- Assume active development happens on a feature branch called "feature/kanban-board"
- Generate clean, small commit suggestions after each major change
- Do not modify .git or .gitignore unnecessarily

Project goal:
Create a lightweight Kanban Board system with:
- Entities: Board, Column, Task (Board has Columns, Column has Tasks)
- Drag & Drop for Tasks using HTML5 Drag & Drop + AJAX
- Sorting of tasks with persisted positions
- JSON endpoint for updating task order

General code rules:
- Provide complete file paths for all created/updated files
- Use PHP 8 attributes for Doctrine mappings
- Comment important code sections in clear English
- Use Tailwind utility classes in all HTML
- Use Twig for views
- Write all UI texts, variable names, and comments in English
